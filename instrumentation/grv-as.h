   american fuzzy lop - injectable parts
   -------------------------------------

   Written and maintained by Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@google.com>

   Forkserver design by Jann Horn <jannhorn@googlemail.com>

   This file houses the assembly-level instrumentation injected into fuzzed
   programs. The instrumentation stores XORed pairs of data: identifiers of the
   currently executing branch and the one that executed immediately before.

   TL;DR: the instrumentation does shm_trace_map[cur_loc ^ prev_loc]++

   The code is designed for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 systems. Both modes should
   work everywhere except for Apple systems. Apple does relocations differently
   from everybody else, so since their OSes have been 64-bit for a longer while,
   I didn't go through the mental effort of porting the 32-bit code.

   In principle, similar code should be easy to inject into any well-behaved
   binary-only code (e.g., using DynamoRIO). Conditional jumps offer natural
   targets for instrumentation, and should offer comparable probe density.
